## SeeMMC - A SD-Card adaptor for eMMC ICs

A small project to connect onboard eMMC ICs to an SD-Card slot.

The adaptor includes a level translator and 1.8V supply, to prevent damage to other board components.

This will only work for boards that have accessible eMMC signals, and can prevent onboard CPU from intervening.

To fit in a SD card slot, this design has to be manufactured with a PCB thickness of 1.2mm, not the default 1.6mm.

Successfully manufactured and tested, managed to extract the FW of a Samsung TV.
